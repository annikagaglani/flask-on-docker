# Flask on Docker

## Overview
This repository follows this tutorial: https://testdriven.io/blog/dockerizing-flask-with-postgres-gunicorn-and-nginx/

This repo contains a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload and serve media images. This application is containerized using Docker and organized with Docker Compose, with Nginx handling static and media file requests in production. Users can upload images through a simple web interface and access them through the media endpoint.
